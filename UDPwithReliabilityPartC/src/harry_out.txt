Book 3: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
Date it hit shelves: July 8, 1999
What happens in the book: Harry ends another insufferable summer at the Dursleys and hears about an escaped murderer, Sirius Black,
in the Muggle news. The wizarding world is also buzzing about the infamous Sirius, who had been held at Azkaban, a maximum-security
prison for those who have committed severe crimes.
Mr. Weasley warns Harry that Sirius is after him. At Hogwarts, Dumbledore informs students that the school will be guarded by the
dreaded Dementors, Azkaban guards who can suck the souls out of wizards.
Hermione exhibits strange behavior and seems to be enrolled in every single class, even those with conflicting times.
Harry, Hermione and Ron enroll in Professor Trelawny's Divination class and Hagrid's Care of Magical Creatures class.
Harry loses the first Quidditch match of the season when Dementors storm the field in search of Sirius.
When he learns that Sirius betrayed his parents and are to blame for their death, Harry vows to kill him. But Harry soon
discovers that Peter Pettigrew — once a good friend to Harry's parents and Sirius — was in fact responsible for betraying the
Potters' whereabouts to Voldemort. Sirius, it turns out, is actually Harry's godfather.
The Dementors find Sirius and are about to suck his soul when Hermione magically turns back time. Harry then conjures a powerful
Patronus charm to save Sirius. Still a wanted wizard, Sirius goes into hiding, and Harry sadly returns to the Dursleys.
Let's start at the very beginning
A very good place to start
When you read you begin with A B C
When you sing you begin with Do Re Mi
Do Re Mi, Do Re Mi
The first three notes just happen to be
Do Re Mi, Do Re Mi
Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti
Let's see if I can make it easier
Doe, a deer, a female deer
Ray, a drop of golden sun
Me, a name I call myself
Far, a long, long way to run
Sew, a needle pulling thread
La, a note to follow Sew
Tea, I drink with jam and bread
That will bring us back to Do, oh oh oh
Doe, a deer, a female deer
Ray, a drop of golden sun
Me, a name I call myself
Far, a long, long way to run
Sew, a needle pulling thread
La, a note to follow Sew
Tea, I drink with jam and bread
That will bring us back to
Doe, a deer, a female deer
Ray, a drop of golden sun
Me, a name I call myself
Far, a long, long way to run
Sew, a needle pulling thread

Tea, I drink with jam and bread
That will bring us back to Do
Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do, So Do
Now children, Do Re Mi Fa So and so on
Are only the tools we use to build a song
Once you have these notes in your heads
You can sing a million different tunes by mixing them up
Like this
So Do La Fa Mi Do Re
Can you do that?
So Do La Fa Mi Do Re
So Do La Ti Do Re Do
So Do La Ti Do Re Do
Now, put it all together
So Do La Fa Mi Do Re
So Do La Ti Do Re Do
Good
But it doesn't mean anything
So we put in words
One word for every note, like this
When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
Together
When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
Doe, a deer, a female deer
Ray, a drop of golden sun
Me, a name I call myself
Far, a long, long way to run
Sew, a needle pulling thread
La, a note to follow Sew
Tea, I drink with jam and bread
That will bring us back to Do
Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do
Do Ti La So Fa Mi Re
Do Mi Mi
Mi So So
Re Fa Fa
La Ti Ti
Do Mi Mi
Mi So So
Re Fa Fa
La Ti Ti
When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
Doe, a deer, a female deer

So Do La Fa Mi Do Re
So Do La Fa
La So Fa Mi Re
